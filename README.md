# Project Euler

Repository created to save my personal solutions of the 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in C++ language. 
The solutions was optimized from larges inputs and was tested by 
the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler) 
test-cases.

## Input Samples

You can test the programs from the inputSample.txt files on each folder 
with the command:

`./[COMPILED_PROGRAM] < inputSample.txt`

The first row of any sample file has the number of inputs cases, followed 
for the inputs itself 
on the next lines.
